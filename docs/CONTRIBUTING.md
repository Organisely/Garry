# Contributing to Garry

We love contributions! Garry is built by developers, for developers.

## The Meta Way: Use Garry to Contribute to Garry

The best way to contribute to Garry is to use Garry itself! This ensures you experience the workflow firsthand and helps us dogfood our own tool.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
# Then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/garry.git
cd garry
```

### 2. Install Garry

```bash
cargo build --release
cargo install --path .
```

### 3. Configure Garry

Create `.garry/config.toml` with your GitHub token and fork details:

```toml
[vcs]
platform = "github"
host = "github.com"
token = "your-github-token"
repository = "organisely/garry"

[git]
default_remote = "origin"
squash_base = "main"
```

### 4. Use Garry to Contribute!

```bash
# Start your feature
garry start feature/amazing-feature

# Make your changes
# ... edit files ...
git add .
git commit -m "Add amazing feature"

# Squash commits
garry squash

# Upload for review
garry upload --title "Add amazing feature" --description "This PR adds..."

# STOP HERE! Wait for maintainer/bot to merge
# (Don't run garry merge - that's for maintainers only! It will not work if you don't have the maintainer role.)
```
